<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>
  Infinipass is part password generator, part password manager.
  It can generate complex unique passwords based on something you know
  (your passphrase), and something about the service you are accessing
  (such as the domain name) and something unique to you (your username
  for the service).
</p>

<h1>How do I use it?</h1>
<p>
  Create a book to generate multiple passwords with the same passphrase.
</p>
<p>
  First, expand the left menu and click the + button.
</p>
<p>
  Next, name the book and set your passphrase. The longer and more complex
  your passphrase the more difficult it would be for someone to crack it.
</p>
<p>
  Any character is allowed, even foreign languages and emoji.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, add each service you want to generate a password or PIN for.
</p>

<h1>What should I use for my passphrase?</h1>
<p>
  Your passphrase should be something secret that you can remember.
  It can, and should, be long. It can have any combination of characters,
  including combinations of foreign languages and emoji.
</p>
<p>
  Even though it is optional, it is highly recommended that you always
  include a username when generating a password. This can be the username
  that you use to access the service.
</p>
<h1>I just want to use it without saving anything</h1>
<!--<app-quick-generate></app-quick-generate>-->
<p>
  Use the  <a [routerLink]="['/quick']">Quick Generate</a> tool.
</p>

<h1>What's with the emoji?</h1>
<p>
  Three emoji are generated based on your passphrase. When the passphase
  is hidden the emoji can help indicate if the passphrase was typed
  correctly.
</p>
<div>
  <p>For example, suppose your passphrase is</p>
  <span style="font-style:italic">The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog!</span><br />
  <p>This phrase will always generate the following symbols:</p>
  <span style="font-size:42px">üçÄ‚úèüö† </span>
  <p>
    If you later typed the passphrase in incorrectly but remembered
    the symbols you could determine that the passphrase was entered
    incorrectly without seeing the passphrase itself.
  </p>
</div>
<h1>Is it safe?</h1>
<p>
  The web version of this app does not send anything to any server. All
  of your information, including your passphrase and the list of websites
  and services you create, are only saved in your web browser.
</p>
<p>
  It is very important to memorize your passphrase and not share it
  with anyone.
</p>
<p>
  You may also opt to encrypt the local database from the Settings page.
  If the database is encrypted then a password must be provided each
  time the application is started.
</p>
<p>
  The mobile app version also doesn't send anything to a server. The
  mobile app explicitly does not have permissions to access the Internet
  at all.
</p>
<p>
  Since your information is only saved in your web browser or mobile
  device, if you need to access your passwords from another computer
  you will need to type your passphrase and add your services/websites
  again from that device.
</p>
<h1>How do I export or backup my database?</h1>
<p>
  The database can be encrypted and exported for backup or for copying
  to another system from the <a [routerLink]="['/import-export']">Import-Export</a> page.

</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    Your passphrase is combined with the name of the service and
    the username you use for the service, as well as the current
    version number, into a single string.
    Unless set otherwise, the service name and username are converted
    to lower case.
  </li>
  <li>
    The string is passed to WebCrypto's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2">PBKDF2</a> function
    using SHA-512 and iterated 20480 times to generate a 128 bit hash value.
  </li>
  <li>
    The hash value is used to seed a random number generator (sfc32).
  </li>
  <li>
    The random number generator is used to generate each character of
    the password.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, the password shuffled.
  </li>
</ol>
